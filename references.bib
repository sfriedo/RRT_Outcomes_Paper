	abstract = {Although kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment method for patients with ESRD, most patients are placed on dialysis either while awaiting transplantation or as their only therapy. The question of which dialytic method provides the best patient survival remains unresolved. Survival analyses comparing hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis/continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CAPD/CCPD), a newer and less costly dialytic modality, have yielded conflicting results. Using data obtained from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register, we compared mortality rates between hemodialysis and CAPD/CCPD among 11,970 ESRD patients who initiated treatment between 1990 and 1994 and were followed-up for a maximum of 5 years. Factors controlled for include age, primary renal diagnosis, center size, and predialysis comorbid conditions. The mortality rate ratio (RR) for CAPD/CCPD relative to hemodialysis, as estimated by Poisson regression, was 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.68 to 0.78). No such relationship was found when an intent-to-treat Cox regression model was fit. Decreased covariable-adjusted mortality for CAPD/CCPD held within all subgroups defined by age and diabetes status, although the RRs increased with age and diabetes prevalence. The increased mortality on hemodialysis compared with CAPD/CCPD wa concentrated in the first 2 years of follow-up. Although continuous peritoneal dialysis was associated with significantly lower mortaltiy rates relative to hemodialysis after adjusting for known prognostic factors, the potential impact of unmeasured patient characteristics must be considered. Notwithstanding, we present evidence that CAPD/CCPD, a newer and less costly method of renal replacement therapy, is not associated with increased mortality rates relative to hemodialysis.},

@article{Ricci2006,
abstract = {Acute renal failure (ARF) is a cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in supportive care, outcomes in ARF have improved little over the past decades. The primary goals in management of patients with ARF are to optimize hemodynamic and volume status, minimize further renal injury, correct metabolic abnormalities, and permit adequate nutrition. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is often required to achieve these goals while awaiting renal recovery, but the optimal dose of dialysis in patients with ARF is not known. Extrapolation of required dialysis dose from recommendations in chronic dialysis is unlikely to be appropriate because of the lack of a steady state and differences in distribution volume of urea that are intrinsic to ARF. The prescribed dialysis dose in ARF is often low, and actual delivered dose is often even less than prescribed. Delivery of dialysis in ARF is often hampered by the patient's hypercatabolic state, hemodynamic instability, and volume status, as well as suboptimal vascular access with temporary venous catheters. The impact of intermittent hemodialysis (IHD) versus continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on outcomes in ARF is also not clear. Patient disease severity impacts more than dialysis modality in patient outcome, but when patients are stratified for equal disease severity, CRRT may have potential benefits over IHD in terms of patient survival, fluid and metabolic control, and renal recovery. Strategies associated with improved outcomes that have emerged thus far in ARF are to aim for a time-averaged blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of less than 60 mg/dl with IHD, varying IHD frequency as necessary, or to achieve a minimum ultrafiltration rate of 35 ml/kg/hr with CRRT.},

abstract = {The main objective of this manuscript is to report on research where we took advantage of those available technological advancements to develop prediction models for kidney dialysis survivability, and also the main goal of medical data mining techniques is to get best algorithms that describe given data from multiple aspects. The number of patients on hemodialysis due to end stage kidney disease is increasing. The median survival for these patients is only about 3 years and the cost of providing care is high. Finding ways to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of dialysis is a challenging task. Dialysis care is complex and multiple factors may influence patient survival. More than 50 parameters may be monitored while providing a kidney dialysis treatment. Understanding the collective role of these parameters in determining outcomes for an individual patient and administering dividualized treatments is of importance. Individual patient survival may depend on a complex interrelation ship between multiple demographic and clinical variables, medications, and medical interventions. In this research, three data mining techniques (Artificial Neural Networks, Decision tree and Logical Regression) are used to elicit knowledge about the interaction between these variables and patient survival. A performance comparison of three data mining techniques is employed for extracting knowledge in the form of classification rules. The concepts introduced in this research have been applied and tested using a data collected at different dialysis sites. The computational results are reported. Finally, ANN is suggested for Kidney dialysis to get better results with accuracy and performance.},

abstract = {The cost for providing care for patients on hemodialysis due to end stage kidney disease is high. Finding ways to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of dialysis is important. Dialysis care is intricate and multiple factors may influence patient survival. Over 50 parameters may be monitored on a regular basis in providing kidney dialysis treatments. Understanding the collective role of these parameters in determining outcomes for an individual patient and administering individualized treatments allowing specific interventions is a challenge. Individual patient survival may depend on a complex interrelationship between multiple demographic and clinical parameters, medications, medical interventions, and the dialysis treatment prescription. In this research, data preprocessing, data transformations, and a data mining approach are used to elicit knowledge about the interaction between many of these measured parameters and patient survival. Two different data mining algorithms were employed for extracting knowledge in the form of decision rules. These rules were used by a decision-making algorithm, which predicts survival of new unseen patients. Important parameters identified by data mining are interpreted for their medical significance. The concepts introduced in this research have been applied and tested using data collected at four dialysis sites. The computational results are reported in the paper. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Supervised machine learning models boast remarkable predictive capabilities. But can you trust your model? Will it work in deployment? What else can it tell you about the world? We want models to be not only good, but interpretable. And yet the task of interpretation appears underspecified. Papers provide diverse and sometimes non-overlapping motivations for interpretability, and offer myriad notions of what attributes render models interpretable. Despite this ambiguity, many papers proclaim interpretability axiomatically, absent further explanation. In this paper, we seek to refine the discourse on interpretability. First, we examine the motivations underlying interest in interpretability, finding them to be diverse and occasionally discordant. Then, we address model properties and techniques thought to confer interpretability, identifying transparency to humans and post-hoc explanations as competing notions. Throughout, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of different notions, and question the oft-made assertions that linear models are interpretable and that deep neural networks are not.},

Our models are decision lists, which consist of a series of if {\ldots} then. . . statements (e.g., if high blood pressure, then stroke) that discretize a high-dimensional, multivariate feature space into a series of simple, readily interpretable decision statements. We introduce a generative model called Bayesian Rule Lists that yields a posterior distribution over possible decision lists. It employs a novel prior structure to encourage sparsity. Our experiments show that Bayesian Rule Lists has predictive accuracy on par with the current top algorithms for prediction in machine learning. Our method is motivated by recent developments in personalized medicine, and can be used to produce highly accurate and interpretable medical scoring systems. We demonstrate this by producing an alternative to the CHADS2 score, actively used in clinical practice for estimating the risk of stroke in patients that have atrial fibrillation. Our model is as interpretable as CHADS2, but more accurate.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for building probabilistic rule lists that is two orders of magnitude faster than previous work. Rule list algorithms are competitors for decision tree algorithms. They are associative classifiers, in that they are built from pre-mined association rules. They have a logical structure that is a sequence of IF-THEN rules, identical to a decision list or one-sided decision tree. Instead of using greedy splitting and pruning like decision tree algorithms, we fully optimize over rule lists, striking a practical balance between accuracy, interpretability, and computational speed. The algorithm presented here uses a mixture of theoretical bounds (tight enough to have practical implications as a screening or bounding procedure), computational reuse, and highly tuned language libraries to achieve computational efficiency. Currently, for many practical problems, this method achieves better accuracy and sparsity than decision trees; further, in many cases, the computational time is practical and often less than that of decision trees. The result is a probabilistic classifier (which estimates P(y = 1|x) for each x) that optimizes the posterior of a Bayesian hierarchical model over rule lists.},

However, deep models lack interpretability which is crucial for wide adoption in medical research and clinical decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet powerful knowledge-distillation approach called interpretable mimic learning, which uses gradient boosting trees to learn interpretable models and at the same time achieves strong prediction performance as deep learning models. Experiment results on Pediatric ICU dataset for acute lung injury (ALI) show that our proposed method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for morality and ventilator free days prediction tasks but can also provide interpretable models to clinicians.},

Within this paper, we outline the basic characteristics of the SAP HANA database, emphasizing the distinctive features that differentiate the SAP HANA database from other classical relational database management systems. On the technical side, the SAP HANA database consists of multiple data processing engines with a distributed query processing environment to provide the full spectrum of data processing -- from classical relational data supporting both row- and column-oriented physical representations in a hybrid engine, to graph and text processing for semi- and unstructured data management within the same system. From a more application-oriented perspective, we outline the specific support provided by the SAP HANA database of multiple domain-specific languages with a built-in set of natively implemented business functions. SQL -- as the lingua franca for relational database systems -- can no longer be considered to meet all requirements of modern applications, which demand the tight interaction with the data management layer. Therefore, the SAP HANA database permits the exchange of application semantics with the underlying data management platform that can be exploited to increase query expressiveness and to reduce the number of individual application-to-database round trips.},
